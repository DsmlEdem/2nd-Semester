This directory contains tools to make conversion on datafiles to be in proper format for the apriori implementation made by Ferenc Bodon.

The input file of apriori has to be in market-basket format.
In a market-basket file each basket (transaction) is repseneted by a line of the file.
Each line contains items that have to be integer values.
Items are separated by a nonnumeric character (comma, white space, colon, etc.).
An example for this kind of file:

2 5 12
1 4 3
4 5
Note, that items in a line do not have to be ordered!


However, most database system stores the data in relational database.
Relational databases have constant number of columns, so the database above would be stored like this:

1,2
1,5
1,12
2,1
2,4
2,3
3,4
4,5

What is more! In most cases the item are not represented by integers but stored as string.

1,butter
1,bread
1,salt
2,curd
2,milk
2,sugar
3,milk
4,bread

So we have to solve 3 problems:
	1, We have to code items to integer values.
	2, We have to convert relational database to market-basket format.
	3, The output of apriori has to be decoced (integers to strings)


Coding item is solved by the code_basket batch file, converting to market-basket model by the convert_basket.
The program decode_item decodes the items. Obviously code_basket will generate a code table file that is used by decode_item.
The 4 steps are included in the run_me batch file. Thus, if you have a text file of relational database style, that contains item as string, just evoke the run_me program. It needs 4 parameters:
	- the input file,
	- the file the output should write to
	- support threshold
	- confidence threshold

To try how it works type "./run_me example_input.txt output 0.2 0.2".
Have fun!
